# **_Lee Sin Shooter_**
This is a game I spent about 3-4 weeks making and fine tuning in python using pygame

## Instructions on How to Play

Don't let Lee Sin, your player, get hit by the girls shot from Vel'koz, the alien guys.
When you get hit you lose one shield and if you lose all your shields you die. The average score is
9,000 abd the highest score i've seen someone get is 17,000. GLHF
