## Backstory Of Characters
1. **Lee Sin**

Lee Sin was a man who came into the Shojun monastery as a boy. He was a very talented warrior and craved more and more power. Until one day where he disobeyed his tutor by going into the hidden archives and reading an ancient text that helped him call upon the spirit realm. One combat lesson he used this power as he kicked his instructer with the "Dragon Kick" and paralized him. Lee Sin left the monastery to use this power for the better good.

2. **Vel'Koz**

Vel'Koz is the first Void-spawn to emerge on Runeterra (Earth). He is a very cruel and no one can calculate his sentience. He seeks to research the living life on Runeterra and use this information to find any weaknesses that would help the void overtake the earth.

## Controls

![Press Spacebar to shoot and "a" and "d" to move ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RareSwag/leesin_shooter/master/keyboard.jpg "Controls for the game")

**When you move the lasers will stop shooting, work on timing the lasers with your movements.**

## How The Game Plays

As the game goes on you will go through many waves of Vel'Koz. As the waves pass on the aliens will increase in count, shoot more, and move alot faster. Your goal is to score as many points as possible before your shield is destroyed and/or overrun. You increase your score by shooting and hitting Vel'Koz. Every 4th shot that you fire will do extra damage to the aliens, hence why it is a red color. At the end of the game you can view your final score and restart by pressing the space bar.
