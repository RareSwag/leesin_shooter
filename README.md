# _Lee Sin Shooter_
This is a game I spent about 4-5 weeks making and fine tuning in python using pygame

When you get hit you lose one shield and if you lose all your shields you die. The average score is
9,000 and the highest score i've seen someone get is 17,000. GLHF


## Backstory Of Characters
1. Lee Sin
Lee Sin was a man who came into the Shojun monastery as a boy. He was a very talented warrior and craved more and more power. Until one day where he disobeyed his tutor by going into the hidden archives and reading an ancient text that helped him call upon the spirit realm. One combat lesson he used this power as he kicked his instructer with the "Dragon Kick" and paralized him. Lee Sin left the monastery to use this power for the better good.

2. Vel'Koz
Vel'Koz is the first Void-spawn to emerge on Runeterra (Earth). He is a very cruel and no one can calculate his sentience. He seeks to research the living life on Runeterra and use this information to find any weaknesses that would help the void overtake the earth.
